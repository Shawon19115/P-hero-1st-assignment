        <p>
          I’m a web developer. I spend my whole day, practically every day,
          experimenting with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. build websites that
          delight and inform. I do it well. I’m curious, and I enjoy work that
          challenges me to learn something new and stretch in a different
          direction. I do my best to stay on top of changes in the state of the
          art so that I can meet challenges with tools well suited to the job at
          hand.

            I am the master of HTML, CSS and Javascript. I know everything
            needed to make a website function, efficient. I didn't stop with the
            web. I went beyond with most popular Javascript framework called
            Node JS. I even know the deployment, server and security. I will
            give you 100% web solution.

            They didn't offer me a job. But I made myself as a remove web
            developer. I made their website and showed it to them. They liked
            it. And uploaded the content. It was fun working at Programming
            Hero.
